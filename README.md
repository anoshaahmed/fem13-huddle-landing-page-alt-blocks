## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

- Keyframes
- Focus-visibility pseudoelement
- Animation-fill-mode property

### Continued development

- For this project, I used desktop-first approach after a long time of not using it. And it really helped me understand once and for all, that that is the best approach. I spent a lot of time working on media queries (smh). So, in the future, I will always design mobile-first.
